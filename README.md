A digital library of wisdom — a curated collection of profound insights and timeless quotes across philosophy, psychology, business, and personal development.

## 🌟 About

Quoted is more than just a quote repository. It's a thoughtfully organized digital library that connects deep wisdom across multiple domains of human knowledge. Each topic page contains carefully selected quotes that build upon each other to form a cohesive understanding of fundamental life principles.

## 🎯 Purpose

In an age of information overload, Quoted serves as a compass for meaningful knowledge. The project aims to:

- **Curate** truly insightful quotes (no clichés or empty platitudes)

- **Provide** a clean, distraction-free reading experience
- **Organize** knowledge in a way that's both accessible and profound
